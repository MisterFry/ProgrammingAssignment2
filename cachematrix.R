## Programing assignemnt 2 requires that we create a pair of functions 
## that can calculate the inverse of a matrix, and cache its inverse. 
## If a call is made to invert the matrix again, the chached matrix is retrieved 
## rather than recomputing the inverse of the matrix. 
## NOTE: We are to assume that the passed matrix is always invertable. (therefore is always square)



## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
      x <<- y
      m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, 
         get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
      message("getting cached data")
      return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
}
